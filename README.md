# PlumeParty

Fancy KSP particle pack

The "Plume Party" is a collection of plumes for parts in KSP. The included configs should not be allowed to persist as ".cfg" files in GameData. They are only to be used as source to add to part configs in other mods. The intricate work is already done. You just need to copy and paste.

Have fun and fly safe™
