// This sample config causes three of the stock Rhino engine to exist, each with the following plumes attached.
// There are two flavors to the Kerolox plumes. Simply replace the "1" suffix (for yellow) with "2" (for orange).
// Note that the vacuum plumes were designed for a 2.5m engine and may be larger than you need, rather than smaller.
